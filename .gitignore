#Should You Track .pyc Files in Git?
#No, .pyc files are machine-dependent and can vary depending on the system and Python version. 
#This means that:
#They are not portable: They are tied to the specific version of Python and the platform (Windows, macOS, etc.) you're using.
#They are unnecessary to track: Every time you run Python on a different system, Python will regenerate .pyc files as needed. They donâ€™t need to be versioned in Git.
